## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to provide information to potential investors for a new bike sharing program in Des Moines.  The Citibike data from August 2018 in New York City was analyzed to get insights into bike usage, time of use (days, hours, length), starting locations and in some cases, further granularity by gender.
