## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to provide information to potential investors for a new bike sharing program in Des Moines.  The Citibike data from August 2018 in New York City was analyzed to get insights into bike usage, time of use (days, hours, length), starting locations and in some cases, further granularity by gender.

## Results

### August Peak Hours
This image shows the peak hours of bike checkouts for the month of August.  We can see high usage at 8am, and in the evening.

## Summary
The 7 above visualizations allow us to make some high level conclusions.  From the time series graph, we can see that the majority of Citibike users are male, although male and female have the same usage patterns.  From the heat maps showing time, we can see that on week days usage peaks during rush hour, with the evening rush hour seeing more volume.  On weekends the time is reversed, with the usage spread out through the day (10am - 7pm).  It can also be seen that the busiest day for bike usage are Thursday and Fridays.  The bikes are used least on Sunday and Wednesdays.

To further explore the data and help provide relevent information to investors, adding a vizialization about the number of users by age group would be valuable insight.  Ages could be grouped in to 5 year increments and the number of rides counted per age group would create an interesting visual.  A second visual that would be insightful would be to look at the number of rides by members vs non-members.  A simple pie chart would effectivelyl demonstrate that information.
